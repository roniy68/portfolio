            One well-known quote about mathematics comes from the famous
            physicist Albert Einstein, who once said, &ldquo;Pure mathematics
            is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.&rdquo; This quote
            captures the essence of mathematics as a creative and abstract
            pursuit, which involves using logic and reasoning to develop new
            insights and ideas.
