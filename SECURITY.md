# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue

At portfolio, we take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose them. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or concerns within the project, please report them to us immediately. This will help ensure the security and privacy of our users and the project as a whole.

To report a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by the project maintainers.
2. Email us at [ahmed.hasan.rony@gmail.com](mailto:ahmed.hasan.rony@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the issue.
3. Include relevant information, such as steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any potential mitigations.
4. We will acknowledge your report within [X days] and provide updates on the progress towards addressing the issue.
5. Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution and include you in the list of responsible reporters, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Please note that this security policy applies to the official releases of portfolio. If you are using a modified or third-party version, please reach out to the respective maintainers for their security policy.

# Supported Versions

We strive to provide security updates for the latest release of portfolio and the previous stable release. It's highly recommended to keep your installation up to date with the latest version to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.

# Security Best Practices

While we actively maintain the security of portfolio, we also encourage users and contributors to follow these best practices to enhance the security of their own deployments:

- Keep portfolio and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
- Enable authentication, authorization, and strong password policies to protect user accounts.
- Regularly backup your data to prevent data loss in case of any unforeseen incidents.
- Restrict server access and permissions to authorized personnel only.
- Review and test custom code or third-party integrations for potential vulnerabilities.

By following these practices and promptly reporting any security concerns, we can collectively maintain a secure environment for all portfolio users.

Thank you for your help in making portfolio a safe and secure project!
